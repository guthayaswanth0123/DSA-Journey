STL:
->STL (Standard Template Library) is a collection of ready-made classes and functions in C++ that help you write programs faster and easier
-> STL provides built-in data structures and algorithms.
-> Instead of writing code from scratch, you can use STL.
-> it provides ready amde data structyures and algorithms
STL has 4 Main Parts:
1)containers -> store data
->container is an object that stores multiple values
2)algorithms -> operations on data
3)Iterators -> traverse containers
4)Functions/comparators 

1)Cointainers -> a container is a data structure that stores multiple elements (values or objects) in an organized way.
-> A container is an object that holds a collection of elements like numbers, strings, or objects.
EX: vector,list,stck,queue,set,map
Types of Containers:
i)Sequenece Containers:
-> store elemenst in order
EX: Vector -> dynmaic array
    list -> doubly linked list
    dequeue -> double ended queue
    array ->  fixed array

ii) Asscoiative containers -> Store elements sorted automatically
Ex:set,map,multiset,multimap

iii)Conatiner Adapaters:
Container adapters are special containers that use another container internally but give restricted operations.
-> They do NOT store data directly like vector or list.
-> They adapt another container (like vector, deque, list).
-> Container adapters are containers that provide a special way to access elements (like stack, queue) using another container internally.
Ex: Stack,Queue,prority_queue



2)Algorithms:
-> STL Algorithms are ready-made functions that perform operations on containers like vector, set, map, deque etc.
-> Algorithm = Pre-written function to process data in containers

i)sorting algorithms
 ->sort()
 ->reverse()
 ->partial_sort()
ii)Seraching Algorithms
 ->find()
 ->binary_search()
 ->count()
iii)Numeric algorithms
 ->gcd()
 ->accumulate()
iV)min/max algorithms
 ->min()
 ->max()
 ->min_element()
 ->max_element()
v)Modification algorithms
 ->fill()
 ->swap()
 ->replace()


3)Iterators
-> An iterator is an object that points to elements inside a container and helps you traverse (move through) the container.
-> Iterator = Pointer-like object used to access container elements

4)Functions/comparators
functions:
Functions are used to perform operations on container elements.
compartaors:
Comparator = Function used to define custom sorting order
->Which element should come first?

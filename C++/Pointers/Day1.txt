Pointer:
-> is variable that stores the address of another variable
Pointers in C++ are a symbolic representation of addresses.
They enable programs to simulate call-by-reference and create and manipulate dynamic data structures.
->Pointers store the address of variables or a memory location. 
->Can be reassigned to point to another variable
->Can be nullptr
->Requires dereferencing to access the value
->Has its own memory address


The process of accessing the value present at the memory address pointed by the pointer is called dereferencing. 
cout<<*P;


Pointer Decleartion:
int *p;
float *p;
char *c;

Pointer initilization:

*p=&x;

Types of Pointers:
1)Null Pointer -> used to avoid garbage values
  -> pointer that points to nothing
  int *p=NULL:
  int *p=nullptr;

2)Void Pointer -> 
  -> pointer that can store any type of address
  void *p;
  -> need typecasting to access values
3)Wild Pointer 
 -> pointer not initiliazed
 int *p;

4)Dangling Pointer
 pointer pointing to deleted memory
 int *p = new int;
 delete p;


Advanced Types of pointers:
1)Duble pointer
2)Function pointer
3)Array pointer
4)Constant pointer
5)Smart pointer

Pointer Arithmetic:

Incrementing and Decrementing
Addition of Integer
Subtraction of Integer
Subtraction of Two Pointers of the Same Type
Comparison of Pointers and NULL


Pointer to Pointer
We can also have pointers that point to other pointers. This is called a double pointer
, and it is useful when working with multi-level data structures like arrays of pointers or dynamic memory management.



The new and delete keywords are used for dynamic memory allocation (creating memory during program execution

NEW keywords
-> The new keyword is used to allocate memory dynamically (at runtime).
int *p = new int

Meaning
Memory is created in heap memory
p stores the address of allocated memory


DELETE keyword
-> The delete keyword is used to free allocated memory.
delete p 
-> without delete memory leak


Normal Varible:
int x=10;
stored in stack memory automaticlaly deleted

Dynamic Vraible:

int *p= new int;

must delete manually


Why we use pointers in c++?
1)Direct memory access
->Pointers allow you to work with memory addresses.
->This makes C++ fast and efficient
2)Dynamic Memory allocation
->Pointers allow creating memory at runtime.
->Without pointers → dynamic memory not possible.
3)Data Structures Implementation
->linkedlist,graphs,trees,heap
4)System Programming
-> C++ is used for os,drivers,embeded systems
->These need hardware-level memory control.
Pointers make this possible.




pointer functions:

1)call by value
->In call by value, a copy of the variable is sent to the function.
->Original variable does NOT change.


2)Call by pointer
->In call by pointer, the address of variable is sent to function.
->Original variable changes.
